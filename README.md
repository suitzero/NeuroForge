# JSFlow: A JAX/XLA-inspired framework for JavaScript/TypeScript

JSFlow is an experimental project aimed at exploring the creation of a numerical computing and machine learning framework for JavaScript and TypeScript, drawing inspiration from the capabilities of Python's JAX and XLA.

## Vision

The long-term vision for JSFlow includes:

*   **Efficient Numerical Operations:** A robust library for multi-dimensional array (tensor) operations.
*   **Composable Function Transformations:**
    *   Automatic differentiation (`grad`).
    *   Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to optimized JavaScript or WebAssembly (`jit`).
    *   Vectorization (`vmap`) and parallelization (`pmap`) capabilities.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Leveraging WebGPU for execution on GPUs where available, and efficient CPU execution via optimized JavaScript or WebAssembly.
*   **Extensible IR:** A well-defined Intermediate Representation (IR) to enable powerful optimizations and target various backends.

## Current Status

This project is in its very early stages. We are currently setting up the foundational project structure, including:

*   TypeScript configuration.
*   Basic IR data structures.
*   Exploring core concepts for function tracing and transformation.

## Getting Started (Placeholder)

(Instructions on how to build, test, and use the library will be added here as the project develops.)

## Contributing

(Contribution guidelines will be added as the project matures.)
